<p>1. ER Diagram: </p>
<img src="image/erdiagram.jpg" alt="" style="width:600px;height:420px;">
<p>2. Description: </p>
<p>I did requirement 1 – 13, including web pages, functions, database, and routing.
and I did not do 14 – 16, I am not clear how to do the time validation and booking validation.
</p>
<p>3. Reflection: </p>
<p>When I start, I draw an image diagram of this website. I make all pages first and use route to connect them. 
I tested my code after I finish each part of a page. When I meet problems, I google it, and searched it on php learning website. 
For Assignment 2, I will do it early than this assignment, and I will make it more completely.</p>
